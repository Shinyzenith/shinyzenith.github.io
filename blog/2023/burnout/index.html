I went through a major surgery, in addition to various other treatments, from which I haven’t yet fully recovered physically. My nose bleeds like an open faucet practically every day.</p><p>Too many relationships with close friends degraded in the past 6 months due to my own failure to set my priorities straight.</p><p>I tried to turn to <code>FOSS</code> and force myself to work as an escape from reality, to forget for a second all the horrible things that had been done to me lately.</p><p>It seems I cannot run away from my feelings or emotions anymore. It’s time to face the demons that have affected me so deeply; I can no longer run away from them.</p><p>My appetite has been reduced to a non-existent status. I’ve lost way too much weight along with the motivation to do practically anything, not to mention the insomnia I’m suffering from.</p><p>Attempting to not focus on the pain and anger inside me and instead redirecting it onto <code>FOSS</code> has led to me hating the thing I loved the most: hacking on software.</p><p>My motivation and will to wake up every day keep waning more and more just when I realize that I am suffering while someone was able to hurt me so deeply and just <em>walk</em> away, <em><strong>unscathed</strong></em>. It feels unfair.</p><p>I don’t know the purpose of this blog post. Take it as you may.</p><p><a href=https://youtu.be/5yYMicbSf98>At least some things calm me down.</a></p></article></main><footer>© 2023 Aakash Sen Sharma

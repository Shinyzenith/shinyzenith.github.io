I'm **Aakash Sen Sharma**, a Linux & Wayland enthusiast. I write open-source software ~~and use [ArtixLinux](https://artixlinux.org) btw.~~

I'm currently learning about the [Wayland protocol](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/), and writing Wayland compositors/clients all of which are on my
GitHub under copyleft licenses.

Most of my projects are on [GitHub](https://github.com/shinyzenith/) and [SourceHut](https://sr.ht/~shinyzenith/).

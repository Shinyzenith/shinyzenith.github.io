Being drunk in the wayland craze
I took it upon myself to rewrite BSPWM for Wayland. Since the waycrate team has already finished rewriting &lt;a href="https://github.com/waycrate/swhkd">sxhkd for wayland&lt;/a>,
this makes my work a tad bit simpler.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have decided to name the window manager HerbWM which &lt;a href="https://github.com/uncomfyhalomacro">uncomfyhalomacro&lt;/a> came up with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://github.com/pmunch/futhark">futhark&lt;/a> library has done nothing but shock me with it&amp;rsquo;s fantastic support for C. I have no regrets with respect
to using the library other than the fact that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t support inline functions or function like macros, a common work around to this is just to
redefine the inline function in nim.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently the source code of &lt;a href="https://github.com/waycrate/herbwm">HerbWM&lt;/a> is written in Zig but I have already started implementing
&lt;a href="https://github.com/waycrate/nim-wl">tinywl in nim&lt;/a> which if successful, will be merged into upstream herbwm.&lt;/p></description><category>Nim</category><category>Wayland</category></item></channel></rss>
